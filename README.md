# Bird Count Analysis Project
This project analyzes bird count data and generates hypothetical observations.
## introduction
This project analyzes bird count data using maximum likelihood estimation and fits the data with a simple linear regression model.
The data file bird_count.csv contains bird counts from one site from the years 1999 to 2012. Formulate a model for Poisson regression with year as predictor and we are not allowed to use ready available functions.
